# Image-based-Meme-Generation-using-Deep-Learning
Memes are a popular form of internet humor that have become pervasive in modern culture. Meme generation using deep neural networks is an innovative application of AI that combines cutting-edge technologies to automatically generate engaging memes. In this project, we'll use Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and AI to create memes that are visually appealing and have witty captions. The goal is to create a system that generates high-quality memes with minimal human intervention, streamlining the process and making it more efficient.

The key innovation in our proposed model is the ability to generate memes based on input images using suggested captions created by the model itself. Unlike traditional approaches, where captions are manually created and paired with images, our model streamlines the process by generating both the caption and the meme automatically.
By achieving this goal, we can improve the efficiency of meme generation, while also creating a new tool for creative expression and communication in the digital age.
